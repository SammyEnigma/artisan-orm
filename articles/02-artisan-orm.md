# Artisan.Orm — How to Reinvent the Wheel

CodeProject has since gone read-only; this re-publication preserves the original content. A handful of small fixes were applied during conversion:
> - `(string)drr["Name"]` had a typo `drr` — fixed to `dr`;
> - `[MapperFor(typeof(User)]` was missing its closing parenthesis — fixed;
> - `cmd.ReadTo<User>;` was missing parentheses — fixed to `cmd.ReadTo<User>()`;
> - `public <T> GetByCommand<T>(...)` was missing its return type — fixed to `public T GetByCommand<T>(...)`;
> - the C# samples that use plain primitives have been switched from `Int32` / `String` to `int` / `string` for readability. The `MapperFor` examples keep `Int32` / `String` because that is how the library's `DataTableExtensions.AddColumn<T>` API is still presented.

ADO.NET Micro-ORM to SQL Server.

In this article you will read about a tiny micro-ORM that I wrote, which only works with SQL Server and has basic functionality for storing and reading data. But at least it performs what is expected and does it well! This article is about why I did that, and how.

This article is a continuation and development of:

- [How to Save an Object Graph in Master-Detail Relationship with One Stored Procedure](01-object-graph-saving.md)

The next articles:

- [The Artisan Way of Data Reply](#) *(to be re-published)*
- [Combination of Id-ParentId and HierarchyId Approaches to Hierarchical Data](04-hierarchyid-combination.md)

## Introduction

Have you read the article *Don't write your own ORM*? I have. And I was very depressed by the end of it. But not for too long — only until the first comment underneath:

> Coders: if you want to write an ORM please do so!

Nicholas de Lioncourt, you are my inspirer and hero!

So I did. I wrote my own ORM. The wheel was reinvented again!

Of course, it is not a full and sophisticated ORM like EF; it is just a tiny micro-ORM, which only works with SQL Server and has basic functionality for storing and reading data. But at least it performs what is expected, and does it well.

This article is about why I did that and how.

## Why?

Mostly because I have not found an elegant way to do what I want using the existing ORM frameworks. I am conscious that I may have missed something out of sight.

**My main requirement to the ORM is performance.** I have heard the opinion that the speed of development is more important than a slight subsidence of system performance. And I have seen the consequences: "Our system has matured and become slow." So I cannot relax until everything is done to ensure that the best performance is achieved. Let it be a little more work for my fingers — but I will be able to sleep well afterwards.

**The second** — neither database-first approach nor code-first is good enough; the second part usually suffers. The best solution is to leave an application domain model to the OOP world, a database to the relational world, and let the ORM eliminate the difference.

**The third** — I still believe that an application should work with a database through stored procedures. Yes, I know that we are at the end of 2016, but old school is cool! There are many reasons for that: performance, security, maintainability. Note: I did not say a word about keeping business logic in stored procedures. And one more reason — a stored procedure is an efficient way to save and retrieve object graphs at once.

**The fourth** — in continuation of the previous paragraph — I believe CRUD commands as SQL text in the application code are evil. Not the absolute evil, of course, but at least a terrible sin. The right place to query a database is a repository. And even there — call a stored procedure! That's enough for my auto-da-fé, I guess.

**The fifth** — existing ORMs usually suppose that an application domain model and a database are developed synchronously from the beginning, so objects match tables, property names and types correspond to column names and types. But in the world where I live, it is not always so. Rather often, I find myself in a situation where the application domain model is already created, has a complex OO structure, and it is necessary to make persistent storage for it. Or the other case — when a new UI is being created for a very old legacy database. In such cases I would like to have an instrument that helps me to integrate two different parts with less effort.

The above assertions are my point of view, of course not the ultimate truth. You are free to have another opinion — even the opposite one. :)

To make a long story short, here are my initial targets:

- The best performance
- Full control over data transformation in mappers
- Preferably the repository pattern
- Database interactions mostly through stored procedures
- Convenient multiple-result-sets reading
- Easy table-valued parameter creation
- Overall code reduction

## The Way to My Own ORM

So I started from the beginning — pure ADO.NET. For example, here is how to get a `User` by Id with ADO.NET:

```csharp
public static User GetUserById(int id)
{
    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        using (var cmd = connection.CreateCommand())
        {
            cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
            cmd.CommandText = "select Id, Login, Name, Email from dbo.Users where Id = @Id";

            cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter
            {
                ParameterName = "@Id",
                Direction     = ParameterDirection.Input,
                SqlDbType     = SqlDbType.Int,
                Value         = id
            });

            User user = null;

            connection.Open();
            using (var dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
            {
                if (dr.Read())
                {
                    user = new User
                    {
                        Id    = (int)dr["Id"],
                        Login = (string)dr["Login"],
                        Name  = (string)dr["Name"],
                        Email = (string)dr["Email"]
                    };
                }
            }
            connection.Close();

            return user;
        }
    }
}
```

There is too much code for such a simple sample. Imagine what it would be for a whole object-graph saving!

## Data-to-Object Mapping

Almost the whole code can be refactored into extension methods on `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand` and `SqlDataReader` — except for the part inside the `using ... ExecuteReader` block:

```csharp
using (var dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
{
    if (dr.Read())
    {
        user = new User
        {
            Id    = (int)dr["Id"],
            Login = (string)dr["Login"],
            Name  = (string)dr["Name"],
            Email = (string)dr["Email"]
        };
    }
}
```

What if we refactor it a little and pull out this `Func` delegate?

```csharp
Func<SqlDataReader, User> createUser = dr =>
{
    return new User
    {
        Id    = (int)dr["Id"],
        Login = (string)dr["Login"],
        Name  = (string)dr["Name"],
        Email = (string)dr["Email"]
    };
};
```

Then a simplified code for the `using ... ExecuteReader` block turns into:

```csharp
using (var dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
{
    if (dr.Read())
        user = createUser(dr);
}
```

Why is this important? Because ORMs are usually based on how to create and use that `Func<SqlDataReader, T>` delegate to create a `T` object.

There is the article *The Tale of Three Monkeys and A Wolf* that demonstrates three main approaches to that task. Dapper, for example, generates that `Func` delegate with `DynamicMethod` and keeps it in cache. This allows the performance to match a hand-written `Func` delegate. It is the best solution for auto-mapping, I think.

But I have a paranoia about black boxes for such critical things as data. And I want to have more power and control over how the data is transformed.

Therefore, for my ORM, I prefer the hand-written `Func` delegate. That means I prepare and keep somewhere the code for data-to-object transformation, while some other ORMs autogenerate it.

Also for `SqlDataReader`, I prefer **ordinal access** rather than access by column name:

```csharp
Func<SqlDataReader, User> createUser = dr =>
{
    var i = 0;
    return new User
    {
        Id    = dr.GetInt32  (i)   ,
        Login = dr.GetString (++i) ,
        Name  = dr.GetString (++i) ,
        Email = dr.GetString (++i)
    };
};
```

Why ordinal access? Because it is faster. And because in that case, the column names don't even matter.

Of course there is always a risk of mixing up the order, but to be on the safe side you can create, for example, a view:

```sql
create view dbo.vwUsers
as
(
    select
        Id      ,
        [Login] ,
        Name    ,
        Email
    from
        dbo.Users
);
```

…and always use `select * from vwUsers` when fetching the User. Yes, I know that `select *` is bad practice — but we are here to break the rules, dude.

## Object-to-Data Mapping

Besides data-to-object mapping, I need the reverse direction — object-to-data.

The technique of object-graph saving means creating user-defined data types for each application domain type that is to be persisted. So I have got two more mapping delegates for a domain type: one to create a `DataTable`, and another to transform an object to a `DataRow`.

## Static Mapper Class

Where to keep those `Func` delegates? My solution is to make a static class with static methods and decorate it with the custom `MapperFor` attribute, like this:

```csharp
[MapperFor(typeof(User))]
public static class UserMapper
{
    public static User CreateObject(SqlDataReader dr)
    {
        var i = 0;
        return new User
        {
            Id    =  dr.GetInt32  (i)   ,
            Login =  dr.GetString (++i) ,
            Name  =  dr.GetString (++i) ,
            Email =  dr.GetString (++i)
        };
    }

    public static DataTable CreateDataTable()
    {
        return new DataTable("UserTableType")
            .AddColumn< Int32  >( "Id"    )
            .AddColumn< String >( "Login" )
            .AddColumn< String >( "Name"  )
            .AddColumn< String >( "Email" );
    }

    public static object[] CreateDataRow(User obj)
    {
        return new object[]
        {
            obj.Id    ,
            obj.Login ,
            obj.Name  ,
            obj.Email
        };
    }
}
```

When the application starts, a special `MappingManager` iterates `MapperFor` attributes, converts the static methods to `Func` delegates, and caches them — for instance in a `Dictionary<Type, Func<SqlDataReader, T>>`.

## Extension Methods

Once there is a cache with `Func` delegates in the application, and it is possible to fetch a delegate by type, all the routine calls of `SqlCommand` or `SqlDataReader` execution can be refactored into generic extension methods:

```csharp
cmd.ReadTo<User>();
cmd.ReadToList<User>();
cmd.AddTableParam("@Records", records);

dr.ReadTo<string>();
dr.ReadToArray<int>();
dr.ReadToDictionary<int, User>();
```

## Auto-Mapping

When property/column names, quantity and types of an object and a database query match, it is safe to use auto-mapping and not write a static mapper. My ORM has several extension methods for those cases:

```csharp
cmd.ReadAs<User>();
cmd.ReadAsList<User>();
dr.ReadAsArray<Record>();
```

The `ReadAs` methods use auto-mapping based on expression-trees compilation:

- When `SqlDataReader` reads the first row from a result set, it calls the expression-trees builder which uses the API.
- The expression-trees builder looks for column names in `SqlDataReader` and matches them to target object properties.
- The expression trees are then compiled into a `Func<SqlDataReader, T>` mapping delegate.
- This mapping delegate is cached into a dictionary with a composite string key.
- The composite key consists of the `SqlCommand` text and the full name of the target object type.
- Therefore every next `SqlDataReader` reading uses the compiled and cached mapping delegate.

So auto-mapping performance is almost the same as the performance of hand-written mappers.

> Damn it. I became a creator of a black box. Am I slipping down to the dark side?

## Read-Methods

The most frequent interaction with a database is data fetching. So the collection of mapper-required and auto-mapping `Read`-methods became the main part of my ORM:

| Read-method | Description |
|---|---|
| `ReadTo<T>` | to read a single value or object using an existing mapper |
| `ReadToAsync<T>` | to read a single value or object asynchronously using an existing mapper |
| `ReadAs<T>` | to read a single object using auto-mapping |
| `ReadAsAsync<T>` | to read a single object asynchronously using auto-mapping |
| `ReadToList<T>` | to read a list of values or objects using an existing mapper |
| `ReadToListAsync<T>` | to read a list of values or objects asynchronously using an existing mapper |
| `ReadAsList<T>` | to read a list of objects using auto-mapping |
| `ReadAsListAsync<T>` | to read a list of objects asynchronously using auto-mapping |
| `ReadToArray<T>` | to read an array of values or objects using an existing mapper |
| `ReadToArrayAsync<T>` | to read an array of values or objects asynchronously using an existing mapper |
| `ReadAsArray<T>` | to read an array of objects using auto-mapping |
| `ReadAsArrayAsync<T>` | to read an array of objects asynchronously using auto-mapping |
| `ReadToObjectRow<T>` | to read a single `ObjectRow` using an existing mapper |
| `ReadToObjectRowAsync<T>` | to read a single `ObjectRow` asynchronously using an existing mapper |
| `ReadAsObjectRows` | to read `ObjectRows` using auto-mapping |
| `ReadAsObjectRowsAsync` | to read `ObjectRows` asynchronously using auto-mapping |
| `ReadToDictionary<TKey, TValue>` | to read a dictionary of objects with the first column as a key, using an existing mapper |
| `ReadToDictionaryAsync<TKey, TValue>` | …asynchronously |
| `ReadAsDictionary<TKey, TValue>` | …using auto-mapping |
| `ReadAsDictionaryAsync<TKey, TValue>` | …asynchronously |
| `ReadToEnumerable<T>` | to read an `IEnumerable` of objects using an existing mapper (sync method only) |
| `ReadAsEnumerable<T>` | to read an `IEnumerable` of objects using auto-mapping (sync method only) |

> The list above is the **v1.x snapshot**. Since then it has been extended with multi-result-set tuple reads (`ReadToLists<T1, T2[, T3[, T4]]>`), `IAsyncEnumerable` streaming (`ReadToAsyncEnumerable<T>` / `ReadAsAsyncEnumerable<T>`), tree builders (`ReadToTree<T>` / `ReadToTreeList<T>`), `dynamic` reads, async tree variants, and `IList<T>?` overloads for pre-populated lists. See [Read Methods Understanding](https://github.com/lobodava/artisan-orm/wiki/Read-Methods-Understanding) on the wiki for the current list.

## Inline Mappers

All the above `ReadTo` extension methods accept `Func<SqlDataReader, T>` as a parameter, so besides separate mappers and auto-mapping, these methods can be used with so-called **inline mappers**:

```csharp
var user = cmd.ReadTo(dr => new User
{
    Id    = dr.GetInt32  (0) ,
    Login = dr.GetString (1) ,
    Name  = dr.GetString (2) ,
    Email = dr.GetString (3)
});
```

## Repository Base

Because I decided to use a repository pattern, I created a base class for all custom repositories. This `RepositoryBase` class can take responsibility for the connection, command creation, and transaction (if the latter is required). One repository can have one connection and one transaction at a time, and create many commands.

In order to encapsulate all the logic of disposing the expensive resources (closing the connection and disposing the command), `RepositoryBase` has methods that create a `SqlCommand` and pass it as an argument to a `Func` or `Action` parameter:

```csharp
public T   GetByCommand<T>(Func<SqlCommand, T> func)
public void RunCommand   (Action<SqlCommand>   action)
public int  ExecuteCommand(Action<SqlCommand>  action)
```

## Repository Methods

Inheriting from `RepositoryBase`, having hand-written mappers and the extension methods for `SqlCommand` and `SqlDataReader` allow making the repository methods more compact, the code more readable, and self-explanatory.

```csharp
public User GetUserById(int id)
{
    return ReadTo<User>("dbo.GetUserById", new SqlParameter("Id", id));
}
```

This is how to save a User and read it back:

```csharp
public User SaveUser(User user)
{
    return GetByCommand(cmd =>
    {
        cmd.UseProcedure("dbo.SaveUser");
        cmd.AddTableRowParam("@User", user);
        return cmd.ReadTo<User>();
    });
}
```

And here is the example from the [previous article](01-object-graph-saving.md), rewritten for ORM use:

```csharp
public IList<GrandRecord> SaveGrandRecords(IList<GrandRecord> grandRecords)
{
    var records      = grandRecords.SelectMany(gr => gr.Records);
    var childRecords = records.SelectMany(r => r.ChildRecords);

    return GetByCommand(cmd =>
    {
        cmd.UseProcedure("dbo.SaveGrandRecords");
        cmd.AddTableParam("@GrandRecords", grandRecords);
        cmd.AddTableParam("@Records",      records);
        cmd.AddTableParam("@ChildRecords", childRecords);

        return cmd.GetByReader(dr =>
        {
            var grandRecords = dr.ReadToList<GrandRecord>();
            var records      = dr.ReadToList<Record>();
            var childRecords = dr.ReadToList<ChildRecord>();
            dr.Close();

            grandRecords.MergeJoin(
                records,
                (gr, r) => gr.Id == r.GrandRecordId,
                (gr, r) => { r.GrandRecord = gr; gr.Records.Add(r); },

                childRecords,
                (r, cr) => r.Id == cr.RecordId,
                (r, cr) => { cr.Record = r; r.ChildRecords.Add(cr); }
            );

            return grandRecords;
        });
    });
}
```

## About Artisan.Orm

The above approach has been tested in several projects and proved its efficiency. So I decided to create a separate library.

I named my project **Artisan.Orm**, because it allows you to neatly and accurately tune up the DAL.

> Ford's conveyor is cool — but Ferraris are assembled by hand. :)

If you are interested in the project, please visit the [Artisan.Orm GitHub page](https://github.com/lobodava/artisan-orm) and its [documentation wiki](https://github.com/lobodava/artisan-orm/wiki). Artisan.Orm is also available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Artisan.ORM/).

## About the Source Code

The original article shipped with a Visual Studio 2015 solution containing three projects:

- **Artisan.Orm** — DLL project containing the Artisan.Orm classes
- **Database** — SSDT project to create the database for SQL Server (used as test data)
- **Tests** — test project with examples of the code in use

Today the source has moved on through several major versions; in particular, v4 (2024) is multi-targeting `netstandard2.1` / `net8.0` / `net10.0`. See [What's New in v4](https://github.com/lobodava/artisan-orm/wiki/Whats-New-in-v4) on the wiki.

## Multiple Exception Output

When an error or exception occurs in a single insert/update/delete statement, it is enough to raise an error and throw an exception with a single error code or message.

It is quite a different challenge when it is required to catch all the issues, throw multiple exceptions that may occur while saving the whole object graph, and transmit this exceptional information to an application client. Artisan.Orm offers its own way of solving this task — read the next article: [The Artisan Way of Data Reply](#).

## Original Publication History

- **16 November 2016** — initial publication.
- **23 November 2016** — added section about auto-mapping via expression trees. Source code updated to v1.0.5.
- **30 December 2016** — added section about Read-methods. Source code updated to v1.0.7.

- **13 June 2017** — added paragraph about Inline Mappers. Source code updated to v1.1.0. Added link to the article *Artisan Way of Data Reply*. Added paragraph about Multiple Exception Output.
- **4 February 2018** — added methods for working with hierarchies. .NET Framework source code updated to v1.1.3. Implemented as a .NET Standard 2.0 library; added .NET Standard source code v2.0.0 with tests for .NET Core.
- **15 June 2020** — final revision on CodeProject.

## What Has Happened Since

The library is now at version 4 (2024), multi-targeting `netstandard2.1`, `net8.0` and `net10.0`. Highlights since this article was first published:

- Async support became universal across the API, with `CancellationToken` parameters where appropriate.
- A `BulkCopy<T>` / `BulkCopyAs<T>` family was added on top of `SqlBulkCopy`.
- Multi-result-set reads via tuple-returning `ReadToLists<T1, T2[, T3[, T4]]>` paired with `MergeJoin` for one-pass parent-child graph assembly.
- Streaming via `ReadToAsyncEnumerable<T>` for queries that don't fit in memory.
- JSON parameters for `OPENJSON`-based round-trips, plus `DateOnly` / `TimeOnly` (NET6+).
- Output-parameter helpers for the nine common SQL types.
- `IAsyncDisposable` support and proper async transactions (`RunInTransactionAsync`).
